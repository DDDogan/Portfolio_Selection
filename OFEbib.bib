abstract = {How much in real estate? To answer this question, uncertainty needs to be introduced into the efficient frontier, so that a confidence interval can be estimated for the real estate weight in a mixed-asset portfolio. Instead of focusing on a single optimal portfolio, this study examines the entire efficient frontier using the traditional point estimate method and the bootstrap simulation. The bootstrap distributions of the estimated weight vectors indicate that their confidence intervals are large enough to render them effectively useless. Once uncertainty is introduced, the efficient frontier becomes fuzzy and the weight vectors become even fuzzier.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter describes the portfolio theory with a special emphasis on its historical evolution and methodological foundations. The early work of Markowitz and Tobin is presented to illustrate the individual contributions of these authors. In the chapter, following these general remarks about the early beginning of portfolio theory, the mean-variance portfolio problem is defined and solved and is related it to its most famous intellectual first fruits, namely the two-fund separation and the capital asset pricing theory of Sharpe and Lintner. The presentation of Roll's critique of the asset pricing theory's tests and the interplay of analysis and empirical testing are described in the chapter as well as an analysis of the foundational assumptions of portfolio theory with respect to investor preferences and asset return distributions. The contrast of methodologies is described in the chapter along with the use of stochastic calculus and stochastic control techniques to generalize the consumption investment problem to an arbitrary number of periods.}
